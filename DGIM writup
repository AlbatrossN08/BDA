'''The DGIM algorithm, which stands for "Datar-Gionis-Indyk-Motwani" after the names of its inventors, 
is a method for estimating the count of 1s in a binary data stream. It's particularly useful when dealing
 with data streams where you need to answer queries about the number of occurrences of a specific value 
 (in this case, 1) within a sliding window.

The key idea behind DGIM is to use a data structure called a "bucket" to represent a range of timestamps
 (positions in the stream) and maintain a compact summary of the recent 1s in the stream. '''

count = 0
k = n
while k > 1
for j = k to n
count = count + 1
end for
k = k/2
